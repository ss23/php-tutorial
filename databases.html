      	<h2>Mix and match</h2>
	<p>One of the most compelling things PHP has going for it is its
	support for a variety of database management systems, including MySQL,
	PostgreSQL, Oracle and Microsoft Access. By virtue of this support, PHP
	developers can create sophisticated data-driven Web applications at a
	fraction of the time and cost required by competing alternatives. And
	nowhere is this more clear than in PHP’s longtime support of MySQL, the
	very fast, very reliable and very feature-rich open-source RDBMS.</p>
	<p>By using PHP and MySQL together, developers can benefit from huge
	savings on the licensing costs of commercial alternatives, and also
	leverage off the tremendous amount of thought PHP and MySQL developers
	have put into making sure that the two packages work together
	seamlessly and smoothly. And since both PHP and MySQL are open-source
	projects, when you use the two of them together you know
	you’re getting the most up-to-date technology available. And that’s
	always a good thought to go to bed with.</p>
	<p>OK. Enough of the marketing talk. Let’s get down to business.</p>
	<p>In this issue of PHP 101, I’m going to show you how to use PHP to
	extract data from a database, and use that data to dynamically build a
	Web page. In order to try out the examples in this tutorial, you’ll
	need a working MySQL installation, which you can obtain from the <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL Web site</a>.
	If you have some knowledge of SQL
	(Structured Query Language, the language used to interact with a
	database server) you’ll find it helpful, but it’s not essential.</p>

	<h2>Building blocks</h2>
	<p>In order to use MySQL and PHP together, your PHP build must include
	support for MySQL. On UNIX, this is accomplished by adding the
	--with-mysql option to the configure script
	when building PHP on UNIX, and pointing PHP to the MySQL client
	libraries. On Windows, the MySQL client libraries are built in to
	PHP 4 and activated by default. In PHP 5, pre-built .dll files
	are included with the Windows distribution. Read more about this at
	<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mysql.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mysql.php</a>.</p>
	<p>Unix users should note that PHP 4 ships with a set of MySQL
	client libraries, which are activated by default; however, PHP
	5 no longer bundles these libraries due to licensing issues, so you
	need to obtain, install and activate them yourself. They’re included
	with the MySQL distribution, and are installed automatically when you
	install MySQL. To activate the MySQL extension, ext/mysql,
	add the --with-mysql option to PHP’s configure
	script. For more information on this change, read
	<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.databases.php#faq.databases.mysql.php5">http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.databases.php#faq.databases.mysql.php5</a>.</p>
	<p>And finally (as if all that wasn’t quite confusing enough) PHP 5 also
	comes with a new MySQL extension, called ext/mysqli
	(MySQL Improved). You can use this new extension to access the new
	features in MySQL 4.1.2 or better, and to gain the benefits of improved
	speed and security. To activate this extension on UNIX, add the
	--with-mysqli option to PHP’s configure script,
	and point PHP to the mysql_config program that comes with
	MySQL 4.1 and above. For Windows users, a pre-built version of
	ext/mysqli is included in the win32 PHP distribution. Read
	more about this at <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mysqli.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mysqli.php</a>.</p>
	<p>To figure out which extension you need, use the following rule of thumb:
	<ul>
		<li>If you need the new features in MySQL 4.1.2 or better, or if you’re
		using an older version of MySQL but still want to benefit from the
		speed/security improvements in the new extension, use ext/mysqli.</li>
		<li>If you don’t fall into either of the categories above, or don’t know what I’m
		talking about, use regular ext/mysql.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>In case you were wondering, this tutorial covers both ext/mysql
	and ext/mysqli, so you actually get two for the price of
	one. Keep reading, and let me introduce you to MySQL.</p>

	<h2>Animal magnetism</h2>
	<p>Every MySQL database is composed of one or more tables. These
	tables, which structure data into rows and columns, are what lend
	organization to the data.</p>
	<p>Here’s an example of what a typical table looks like:</p>
	<pre>+----+-----------+----------+
| id | country   | animal   |
+----+-----------+----------+
|  1 | America   | eagle    |
|  2 | China     | dragon   |
|  3 | England   | lion     |
|  4 | India     | tiger    |
|  5 | Australia | kangaroo |
|  6 | Norway    | elk      |
+----+-----------+----------+</pre>
	<p>As you can see, a table divides data into rows, with a new entry (or
	record) on every row. The data in each row is further broken
	down into cells (or fields), each of which contains a value for
	a particular attribute of the data. For example, if you consider the
	record for the country “India”, you’ll see that the record is clearly
	divided into separate fields for record number, country name and
	national animal.</p>
	<p>The rows within a table are not arranged in any particular order -
	they can be sorted alphabetically, by number, by name, or by any
	other criteria you choose to specify. It is therefore necessary to have
	some method of identifying a specific record in a table. In the example
	above, each record is identified by a unique number; this unique field
	is referred to as the primary key for that table.</p>
	<p>You use the Structured Query Language, SQL, to interact with the MySQL
	server and tell it to create a table, mark a field as primary, insert
	records, edit records, retrieve records… basically, anything that
	involves manipulating the data or the database. To see how this works,
	examine the following SQL, which creates the table above:</p>
	{% highlight sql %}
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
CREATE TABLE `symbols` (
	`id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
	`country` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
	`animal` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
	PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) TYPE=MyISAM;
INSERT INTO `symbols` VALUES (1, 'America', 'eagle');
INSERT INTO `symbols` VALUES (2, 'China', 'dragon');
INSERT INTO `symbols` VALUES (3, 'England', 'lion');
INSERT INTO `symbols` VALUES (4, 'India', 'tiger');
INSERT INTO `symbols` VALUES (5, 'Australia', 'kangaroo');
INSERT INTO `symbols` VALUES (6, 'Norway', 'elk');
{% endhighlight %}
	<p>You can enter these commands either interactively or
	non-interactively through the MySQL commandline client program,
	which you run by navigating to the mysql/bin
	directory from your shell or DOS box and typing – with no
	; because this is a shell command – either
	mysql, or mysql db_name if you want
	to choose an existing database to work with. Read
	<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/mysql.html">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/mysql.html</a>
	for more information
	on how to use the MySQL commandline client, and the tutorial at
	<a href="http://www.melonfire.com/community/columns/trog/article.php?id=39">http://www.melonfire.com/community/columns/trog/article.php?id=39</a>
	to understand what each of the SQL commands above does. SQL is a
	lot like spoken English, so it won’t take you very long to pick it
	up. Just don’t try to turn those backticks into single quotation marks.</p>
	<p>Once the data has been imported, run a quick SELECT
	query to check that everything is working as it should be:</p>
	<pre>
mysql> SELECT * FROM `symbols`;
+----+-----------+----------+
| id | country   | animal   |
+----+-----------+----------+
|  1 | America   | eagle    |
|  2 | China     | dragon   |
|  3 | England   | lion     |
|  4 | India     | tiger    |
|  5 | Australia | kangaroo |
|  6 | Norway    | elk      |
+----+-----------+----------+
6 rows in set (0.06 sec)
</pre>
	<p>In English, the query above means “show me all the records from the
	table named symbols“. If you saw the same output as above,
	you’re good to go!</p>

	<h2>Hello database</h2>
	<p>Now, let’s use PHP to do exactly the same thing. You could use PHP
	to set up the database from the start, but as ours already exists
	we’ll simply fire a SELECT query at the database
	‘testdb’, and display the results in an HTML page:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// set database server access variables:
$host = "localhost";
$user = "test";
$pass = "test";
$db = "testdb";
// open connection
$connection = mysql_connect($host, $user, $pass) or die ("Unable to connect!");
// select database
mysql_select_db($db) or die ("Unable to select database!");
// create query
$query = "SELECT * FROM symbols";
// execute query
$result = mysql_query($query) or die ("Error in query: $query. ".mysql_error());
// see if any rows were returned
if (mysql_num_rows($result) > 0) {
	// yes
	// print them one after another
	echo "<table cellpadding=10 border=1>";
	while($row = mysql_fetch_row($result)) {
		echo "<tr>";
		echo "<td>".$row[0]."</td>";
		echo "<td>" . $row[1]."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row[2]."</td>";
		echo "</tr>";
	}
	echo "</table>";
} else {
	// no
	// print status message
	echo "No rows found!";
}
// free result set memory
mysql_free_result($result);
// close connection
mysql_close($connection);
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Here’s what the result looks like:</p>
	<img src="images/part8-table1.png" alt="Resultant table">
	<p>As you can see, using PHP to get data from a database involves
	several steps, each of which is actually a pre-defined PHP function.
	Let’s dissect each step:
	<ol>
		<li><p>The first thing to do is specify some important information needed
		to establish a connection to the database server. This information
		includes the server name, the username and password required to gain
		access to it, and the name of the database to query. These values are
		all set up in regular PHP variables.</p>
		{% highlight php %}<?php
$host = "localhost";
$user = "test";
$pass = "test";
$db = "testdb";
?>{% endhighlight %}
		</li>
		<li><p>To begin communication with a MySQL database server, you need to
		open a connection to that server. All communication between PHP and
		the database server takes place through this connection.</p>
		<p>In order to initialize this connection, PHP offers the
		mysql_connect() function:</p>
		{% highlight php %}<?php
$connection = mysql_connect($server, $user, $pass);
?>{% endhighlight %}
		<p>All the parameters in mysql_connect()are optional, but there
		are three you will generally need to use anywhere beyond your own machine:
		the database server name, username and password. If the database server
		and the Web server are running on the same physical machine, you can use
		localhost as the database server name this is in fact the
		default value supplied by PHP.</p>
		<p>mysql_connect() returns a “link identifier”, which is stored
		in the variable $connection. This identifier is used when
		communicating with the database.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>Once you have a connection to the database, you must select
		a database for use with the mysql_select_db() function:</p>
		{% highlight php %}<?php
mysql_select_db($db) or die ("Unable to select database!");
?>{% endhighlight %}
		<p>This function must be passed the name of the database to be used for
		all subsequent queries. An optional second argument here is the link
		identifier; if no identifier is specified, the last opened link is
		assumed. If you have two or more database connections open
		simultaneously, it’s a good idea to specify the link identifier as the
		second argument to mysql_select_db() – and indeed to all other
		mysql_* functions in the script, so that PHP doesn’t get confused about
		which connection to use where.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>The next step is to create the query and execute it. This
		is accomplished with the mysql_query() function.</p>
		{% highlight php %}<?php
$query = "SELECT * FROM symbols";
$result = mysql_query($query) or die ("Error in query: $query. ".mysql_error());
?>{% endhighlight %}
		<p>This function also needs two parameters: the query string and the
		link identifier for the connection. Again, if no link identifier is
		specified, the last opened link is used. Depending on whether or not
		the query was successful, the function returns true or false; a failure
		can be caught via the ...or die() clause of the statement,
		and the mysql_error() function can be used to display the
		corresponding error message.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>If mysql_query() is successful, the result set returned
		by the query is stored in the variable $result. This result set may
		contain one or more rows or columns of data, depending on your query. You can
		retrieve specific subsets of the result set with different PHP functions,
		including the one used here – the mysql_fetch_row() function -
		which fetches a single row of data as an array called $row. Fields
		in that row can then be accessed using standard PHP array notation.</p>
		<p>Each time you call mysql_fetch_row(), the next record in the result
		set is returned. This makes mysql_fetch_row() very suitable for
		use in a while() or for() loop.</p>
		{% highlight php %}<?php
if (mysql_num_rows($result) > 0) {
	while($row = mysql_fetch_row($result)) {
		echo "<td>".$row[0]."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row[1]."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row[2]."</td>";
	}
}
?>{% endhighlight %}
		<p>Notice that the call to mysql_fetch_row() is wrapped in a
		conditional test, which first checks to see if any rows were returned
		at all. This information is provided by the mysql_num_rows()
		function, which contains the number of rows returned by the query. Obviously,
		you can only use this function with queries that return data, like
		SELECT or SHOW.It is not appropriate for use with
		INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE or similar queries.</p>
		<p>There are several other alternatives to mysql_fetch_row(),
		which will be explained a little later.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>Finally, since each result set returned after a query
		occupies memory, it’s a good idea to use the mysql_free_result()
		function to free up the used memory. After the result set is freed, if no
		further queries are to be run, you can close the connection to the MySQL
		server with mysql_close().</p>
		{% highlight php %}<?php
mysql_free_result($result);
mysql_close($connection);
?>{% endhighlight %}
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Different strokes...</h2>
	<p>You can also use PHP’s mysql_fetch_row() and list()
	functions to obtain a simple array of values, and then assign these values to
	different variables – a variation of the technique in the previous section.
	Take a look (only the while() loop changes):</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// set server access variables
$host = "localhost";
$user = "test";
$pass = "test";
$db = "testdb";
// open connection
$connection = mysql_connect($host, $user, $pass) or die ("Unable to connect!");
// select database
mysql_select_db($db) or die ("Unable to select database!");
// create query
$query = "SELECT * FROM symbols";
// execute query
$result = mysql_query($query) or die ("Error in query: $query. ".mysql_error());
// see if any rows were returned
if (mysql_num_rows($result) > 0) {
	// yes
	// print them one after another
	echo "<table cellpadding=10 border=1>";
	while(list($id, $country, $animal)  = mysql_fetch_row($result)) {
		echo "<tr>";
		echo "<td>$id</td>";
		echo "<td>$country</td>";
		echo "<td>$animal</td>";
		echo "</tr>";
	}
	echo "</table>";
} else {
	// no
	// print status message
	echo "No rows found!";
}
// free result set memory
mysql_free_result($result);
// close connection
mysql_close($connection);
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>In this case, the list() function is used to assign different
	elements of the result set to PHP variables, which are then used when
	rendering the page.</p>
	<p>You can use PHP’s mysql_fetch_assoc() function to represent each
	row as an associative array of field-value pairs – a minor variation of the
	technique used above:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// set server access variables
$host = "localhost";
$user = "test";
$pass = "test";
$db = "testdb";
// open connection
$connection = mysql_connect($host, $user, $pass) or die ("Unable to connect!");
// select database
mysql_select_db($db) or die ("Unable to select database!");
// create query
$query = "SELECT * FROM symbols";
// execute query
$result = mysql_query($query) or die ("Error in query: $query. ".mysql_error());
// see if any rows were returned
if (mysql_num_rows($result) > 0) {
	// yes
	// print them one after another
	echo "<table cellpadding=10 border=1>";
	while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
		echo "<tr>";
		echo "<td>".$row['id']."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row['country']."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row['animal']."</td>";
		echo "</tr>";
	}
	echo "</table>";
} else {
	// no
	// print status message
	echo "No rows found!";
}
// free result set memory
mysql_free_result($result);
// close connection
mysql_close($connection);
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Notice that in this case, field values are accessed using the field
	name instead of the index.</p>
	<p>Of all the alternatives, however, the function I like the most is
	the mysql_fetch_object() function, which returns each
	row as an object (remember them from <a href="part7.html">Part Seven</a>?) with properties
	corresponding to the field names:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// set server access variables
$host = "localhost";
$user = "test";
$pass = "test";
$db = "testdb";
// open connection
$connection = mysql_connect($host, $user, $pass) or die ("Unable to connect!");
// select database
mysql_select_db($db) or die ("Unable to select database!");
// create query
$query = "SELECT * FROM symbols";
// execute query
$result = mysql_query($query) or die ("Error in query: $query. ".mysql_error());
// see if any rows were returned
if (mysql_num_rows($result) > 0) {
	// yes
	// print them one after another
	echo "<table cellpadding=10 border=1>";
	while($row  = mysql_fetch_object($result)) {
		echo "<tr>";
		echo "<td>".$row->id."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row->country."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row->animal."</td>";
		echo "</tr>";
	}
	echo "</table>";
} else {
	// no
	// print status message
	echo "No rows found!";
}
// free result set memory
mysql_free_result($result);
// close connection
mysql_close($connection);
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Here, each $row object is created with properties
	corresponding to the field names in that row. Row values can
	thus be accessed using standard object->property
	notation.</p>
	<p>If you’re the type that likes to have your cake and eat it too, you
	will probably enjoy the mysql_fetch_array() function, which
	returns both an associative array and a numerically-indexed array, a
	combination of the mysql_fetch_row() and
	mysql_fetch_assoc() functions. Read about it at
	<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-fetch-array.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-fetch-array.php</a>.</p>

	<h2>... for different folks</h2>
	<p>If you’re using PHP 5, you can do the same thing using the new
	ext/mysqli extension, which offers a number of new features. This
	extension can be used in two ways: procedural (using functions), and
	object-oriented (using class methods and properties). Consider the next
	script, which uses ext/mysqli in a procedural manner:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// set server access variables
$host = "localhost";
$user = "test";
$pass = "test";
$db = "testdb";
// open connection
$connection = mysqli_connect($host, $user, $pass, $db) or die ("Unable to connect!");
// create query
$query = "SELECT * FROM symbols";
// execute query
$result = mysqli_query($connection, $query) or die ("Error in query: $query. ".mysqli_error());
// see if any rows were returned
if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {
	// yes
	// print them one after another
	echo "<table cellpadding=10 border=1>";
	while($row = mysqli_fetch_row($result)) {
		echo "<tr>";
		echo "<td>".$row[0]."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row[1]."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row[2]."</td>";
		echo "</tr>";
	}
	echo "</table>";
} else {
	// no
	// print status message
	echo "No rows found!";
}
// free result set memory
mysqli_free_result($result);
// close connection
mysqli_close($connection);
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>As you can see, this looks a lot like the code written for
	ext/mysql. The only real difference – at least to the naked eye
	- is the fact that function names now begin with mysqli_* instead of mysql_*.
	Of course, there are a whole bunch of differences under the hood:
	ext/mysqli is faster, more secure and more powerful than regular
	ext/mysql, and also includes support for prepared statements,
	bound result sets, multiple simultaneous queries, transactions and a whole
	bunch of other cool stuff.</p>
	<p>You can also use ext/mysqli in an object-oriented way,
	where each task – connecting, querying, fetching – is actually a method
	of the mysqli() object:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// set server access variables
$host = "localhost";
$user = "test";
$pass = "test";
$db = "testdb";
// create mysqli object
// open connection
$mysqli = new mysqli($host, $user, $pass, $db);
// check for connection errors
if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
	die("Unable to connect!");
}
// create query
$query = "SELECT * FROM symbols";
// execute query
if ($result = $mysqli->query($query)) {
	// see if any rows were returned
	if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
		// yes
		// print them one after another
		echo "<table cellpadding=10 border=1>";
		while($row = $result->fetch_array()) {
			echo "<tr>";
			echo "<td>".$row[0]."</td>";
			echo "<td>".$row[1]."</td>";
			echo "<td>".$row[2]."</td>";
			echo "</tr>";
		}
		echo "</table>";
	} else {
		// no
		// print status message
		echo "No rows found!";
	}
	// free result set memory
	$result->close();
} else {
	// print error message
	echo "Error in query: $query. ".$mysqli->error;
}
// close connection
$mysqli->close();

	<p>Here, the new keyword is used to instantiate an object of class
	mysqli, and pass the object constructor connection information
	(including the database name). The resulting object, stored in the variable
	$mysqli, then exposes methods and properties to perform the
	tasks of querying, fetching and processing rows, and handling errors.</p>
	<p>If you look closely at the two scripts above, you’ll notice the numerous
	similarities between the function and method names, and the structure of
	the script. Of the two, though, the object-oriented method is recommended,
	especially in light of the new object model in PHP 5.</p>
	<p>A couple of other important differences to keep in mind:
	<ol>
		<li>With ext/mysqli, you can include the database name in the
		arguments passed to the mysqli_connect() function or to the
		mysqli()constructor.</li>
		<li>When calling mysqli_query() or the mysqli
		object’s query() method, the link identifier is mandatory,
		not optional.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	<h2>Surgical insertion</h2>
	<p>So now you know how to execute a SELECT query to retrieve a
	result set from the database. However, you can also use PHP’s MySQL API for
	queries that don’t return a result set – for example, an INSERT
	or UPDATE query. Consider the following example, which demonstrates
	this by asking for user input through a form and then INSERT-ing
	that data into the database:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
if (!isset($_POST['submit'])) {
	// form not submitted
	?>
	<form action="<?=$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']?>" method="post">
		Country: <input type="text" name="country"><br>
		National animal: <input type="text" name="animal"><br>
		<input type="submit" name="submit">
	</form>
	<?php
} else {
	// form submitted
	// set server access variables
	$host = "localhost";
	$user = "test";
	$pass = "test";
	$db = "testdb";

	// get form input
	// check to make sure it's all there
	// escape input values for greater safety
	$country = empty($_POST['country']) ? die ("ERROR: Enter a country") : mysql_escape_string($_POST['country']);
	$animal = empty($_POST['animal']) ? die ("ERROR: Enter an animal") : mysql_escape_string($_POST['animal']);

	// open connection
	$connection = mysql_connect($host, $user, $pass) or die ("Unable to connect!");
	// select database
	mysql_select_db($db) or die ("Unable to select database!");

	// create query
	$query = "INSERT INTO symbols (country, animal) VALUES ('$country', '$animal')";
	// execute query
	$result = mysql_query($query) or die ("Error in query: $query. ".mysql_error());

	// print message with ID of inserted record
	echo "New record inserted with ID ".mysql_insert_id();

	// close connection
	mysql_close($connection);
}
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Here, the user is first presented with a form asking for a country
	and its national animal.</p>
	<img src="images/part8-form1.png">
	<p>Once the form is submitted, the form input is used inside to create
	an INSERT query, which is then sent to the database with
	the mysql_query() method. Since mysql_query()
	returns a Boolean value indicating whether the query was successful or
	not, it is possible to check whether the INSERT took place
	and return an appropriate message:</p>
	<pre>New record inserted with ID 8</pre>
	<p>There are two new functions in the example above. The
	mysql_escape_string() function escapes special characters
	(like quotes) in the user input so that it can be safely entered into the
	database; while the mysql_insert_id() returns the ID
	generated by the previous INSERT query (useful only if the
	table into which the INSERT occurs contains an
	AUTO_INCREMENT field). Both these functions are also available
	in ext/mysqli.</p>

	<h2>Wiping out</h2>
	<p>Obviously, you can also do the same thing with other data manipulation
	statements. This next example demonstrates how to use a DELETE
	statement with PHP to selectively delete items from the table. For variety,
	I’m going to use ext/mysqli this time around:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// set server access variables
$host = "localhost";
$user = "test";
$pass = "test";
$db = "testdb";
// create mysqli object
// open connection
$mysqli = new mysqli($host, $user, $pass, $db);
// check for connection errors
if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
	die("Unable to connect!");
}
// if id provided, then delete that record
if (isset($_GET['id'])) {
	// create query to delete record
	$query = "DELETE FROM symbols WHERE id = ".$_GET['id'];
	// execute query
	if ($mysqli->query($query)) {
		// print number of affected rows
		echo $mysqli->affected_rows." row(s) affected";
	} else {
		// print error message
		echo "Error in query: $query. ".$mysqli->error;
	}
}
// query to get records
$query = "SELECT * FROM symbols";
// execute query
if ($result = $mysqli->query($query)) {
	// see if any rows were returned
	if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
		// yes
		// print them one after another
		echo "<table cellpadding=10 border=1>";
		while($row = $result->fetch_array()) {
			echo "<tr>";
			echo "<td>".$row[0]."</td>";
			echo "<td>".$row[1]."</td>";
			echo "<td>".$row[2]."</td>";
			echo "<td><a href=".$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']."?id=".$row[0].">Delete</a></td>";
			echo "</tr>";
		}
	}
	// free result set memory
	$result->close();
} else {
	// print error message
	echo "Error in query: $query. ".$mysqli->error;
}
// close connection
$mysqli->close();
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Here’s what it looks like:</p>
	<img src="images/part8-table2.png" alt="Resultant table">
	<p>Notice my usage of the affected_rows property of the
	mysqli object here – this returns the total number of rows
	affected by the last operation. It’s available in ext/mysql
	as well, as the function mysql_affected_rows().</p>

	<h2>Looking inside</h2>
	<p>PHP comes with a bunch of functions designed to tell you everything
	you would ever want to know about the MySQL client and server, their
	version numbers, the total number of databases available, the tables
	inside each database, the processes running… you name
	it, and it’s probably there. Here’s an example which uses them to give
	you a big-picture view of what’s going on inside your MySQL RDBMS:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// set server access variables
$host = "localhost";
$user = "root";
$pass = "guessme";
$db = "testdb";
// open connection
$connection = mysql_connect($host, $user, $pass) or die ("Unable to connect!");
// get database list
$query = "SHOW DATABASES";
$result = mysql_query($query) or die ("Error in query: $query. ".mysql_error());
echo "<ul>";
while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) {
	echo "<li>".$row[0];
	// for each database, get table list and print
	$query2 = "SHOW TABLES FROM ".$row[0];
	$result2 = mysql_query($query2) or die ("Error in query: $query2. ".mysql_error());
	echo "<ul>";
	while ($row2 = mysql_fetch_array($result2)) {
		echo "<li>".$row2[0];
	}
	echo "</ul>";
}
echo "</ul>";
// get version and host information
echo "Client version: ".mysql_get_client_info()."<br />";
echo "Server version: ".mysql_get_server_info()."<br />";
echo "Protocol version: ".mysql_get_proto_info()."<br />";
echo "Host: ".mysql_get_host_info()."<br />";
// get server status
$status = mysql_stat();
echo $status;
// close connection
mysql_close($connection);
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>The first part of this script is fairly simple: it runs the SHOW
	DATABASES query to get a list of databases, then iterates over the
	list and runs the SHOW TABLES command to retrieve the list
	of tables inside each. Next, the mysql_get_*_info() functions
	provide the client version number, the MySQL version number, the version
	number of the special MySQL client-server protocol used for communication
	between the two, the current host name, and how it is connected to the MySQL
	server. Finally, new in PHP 4.3.0 is the mysql_stat() function,
	which returns a string containing status information on the MySQL server
	(including information on server uptime, open tables, queries per second
	and other statistical information).</p>

	<h2>Oops!</h2>
	<p>All done? Nope, not quite yet – before you go out there and start
	building cool data-driven Web sites, you should be aware that both
	MySQL extensions come with powerful error-tracking functions which can
	speed up development time. Take a look at the following example, which
	contains a deliberate error in the SELECT query string:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// connect
$connection = mysql_connect("localhost", "test", "test") or die("Invalid server or user");
mysql_select_db("testdb", $connection) or die("Invalid database");
// query
$query = "SELECT FROM symbols";
// result
$result = mysql_query($query,$connection);
// look for errors and print
if(!$result) {
	$error_number = mysql_errno();
	$error_msg = mysql_error();
	echo "MySQL error $error_number: $error_msg";  
}
// disconnect
mysql_close($connection);
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>This might output something like:</p>
	<pre>MySQL error 1064: You have an error in your SQL syntax. Check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'FROM symbols' at line 1</pre>
	<p>The mysql_errno() function displays the error code returned
	by MySQL if there’s an error in your SQL statement, while the
	mysql_error() function returns the actual error message. Turn
	these both on, and you’ll find that they can significantly reduce the time
	you spend fixing bugs.</p>
	<p>The ext/mysqli code tree includes two additional functions for
	connection errors, mysqli_connect_errno() and
	mysqli_connect_error(), which contain information on connection
	(not query) errors only. Use these to debug errors in your MySQL connections,
	as in the example below:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// create mysqli object
// open connection
$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "test", "test", "testdb");
// check for connection errors
if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
	die("Unable to connect: ".mysqli_connect_error());
}
// query
$query = "SELECT FROM symbols";
// execute query
$result = $mysqli->query($query);
// look for errors and print
if(!$result) {
	$error_number = $mysqli->errno;
	$error_msg = $mysqli->error;
	echo "MySQL error $error_number: $error_msg"; 
}
// disconnect
$mysqli->close();
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>And in case you were wondering why I haven’t used object syntax for
	these two functions in the script above, it’s actually very simple: I
	can’t. You see, if there is an error in connecting to the server, the
	mysqli() object will not be created, and so methods and
	properties related to that object will not exist. For this reason, to
	debug connection errors in ext/mysqli, you must always use
	the procedural, rather than the object, notation.</p>
	<p>And that’s about all I have for this issue of PHP 101. In
	<a href="part9.html">Part Nine</a> I’m going to tell you all
	about PHP 5′s built-in DBMS alternative, the very cool SQLite database
	engine. Don’t miss it!</p>
